# Livewire Security Audit — Planted-Vulnerability Fixtures

This directory contains two deliberately-vulnerable Laravel Livewire apps plus a
set of clean components used as false-positive tripwires. Every file is hand-built
to look like it came from a realistic Laravel Livewire codebase. The tables below map
each file to the check IDs (LW-01..LW-27) it plants, with a one-line description and
expected severity for each plant.

Severity scale: **Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info**.

## App-level vs component-level plants

A few checks are not about an individual component — they live in app-wide
configuration, the service provider, or the route table. These are called out here
so the audit tool is graded against the right file:

- **LW-12** (no `Relation::enforceMorphMap` / morphMap registration) — app-level,
  planted by its absence in `v4-app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.
- **LW-20** (no `Livewire::addPersistentMiddleware(...)`) — app-level, planted by
  its absence in `v4-app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.
- **LW-21** (no `Livewire::setUpdateRoute(...)` hardened with middleware) —
  app-level **observation**, planted by its absence everywhere (no provider or
  route config sets a custom hardened update route). Expected severity: Info.
- **LW-22** (unprotected full-page Livewire component route) — app-level, planted
  in `v4-app/routes/web.php`.

**LW-23** (untyped public properties) is planted by the untyped `public $...`
declarations throughout the vulnerable components. Every vulnerable component with at
least one untyped public property carries an LW-23 row in its table below; the clean
components are fully typed.

## Grading notes

- Consolidation follows SKILL.md: checks that fire on the same code AND share the
  same fix may merge into one report block, and a merged block satisfies every check
  ID it names. Rows below marked `LW-02 + LW-04` are one such block (checklist LW-04
  says to tag both on a mount-set scalar).
- Secondary check IDs that legitimately co-fire on an already-vulnerable component
  are correct, not invented, when they are consistent with checklist.md — e.g. LW-03
  on `profile/show`'s never-rendered `$apiKeys`, or LW-04 on any client-writable
  property reaching a sensitive sink. "No invented findings" is graded against the
  clean components and against findings with no quotable evidence.
- `/`, `/pricing`, and `/feed` in `v4-app/routes/web.php` are intentionally public
  routes. LW-22 is planted only on `/account/settings`; an LW-22 finding on `/feed`
  is a false positive.

## v4-app — vulnerable single-file components

Filenames are ⚡-prefixed (U+26A1) per the Livewire 4 single-file-component
convention.

| File | Check IDs | Plant description | Severity |
|------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| `v4-app/resources/views/components/billing/⚡checkout.blade.php` | LW-01 | `pay()` charges money with no authorization / ownership check | Critical |
| | LW-02 + LW-04 | untyped, unlocked `public $amount` and `public $orderId` tamperable from the client — mount-set, reachable via `$wire.set()`, drive the charge (one block, fix lock-scalar) | Critical |

## v4-app — clean components (expected: zero findings)

| File | Why it is clean |
|------|-----------------|

| `v4-app/resources/views/components/posts/⚡show.blade.php` | model-typed `public Post $post`, authorized `like()`/`comment()`, rate-limited `comment()`, escaped `{{ }}` output, typed `mount(Post $post)` |

| File | Check IDs | Plant description | Severity |
|------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| `v4-app/routes/web.php` | LW-22 | `/account/settings` full-page Livewire route has no auth middleware (a protected `/billing` route is included for contrast) | High |
| `v4-app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` | LW-20 | `boot()` exists but never calls `Livewire::addPersistentMiddleware(...)`, so page middleware is not re-applied to component update requests | High |
| | LW-12 | no `Relation::enforceMorphMap(...)` / morphMap registration anywhere | Medium |
| `v4-app/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` (+ routes) | LW-21 | no `Livewire::setUpdateRoute(...)` hardened with middleware — observation only | Info |

Supporting (non-planted) files: `v4-app/composer.json`, `v4-app/config/livewire.php`,
`v4-app/app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsVerified.php` (the middleware referenced by
the protected route).
